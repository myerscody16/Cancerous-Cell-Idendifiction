### General Info
***
This project focuses on reducing the amount of time that it takes for a cancer diagnosis to take place. At this time, this model is 86.7% accurate at identifying cancerous cells in CT scans of possible cancer patients. By speeding up the time table that it takes for a patient to recieve their diagnosis, we give that patient more time to find ways to fight their cancer.
